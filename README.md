automatic image analysis for immunofluorescence quantification

Scientists use to analyses microscopic images in ImageJ. Some of them use ImageJ macros to save time. 
There are few who write scripts in java to fully automate the process. In contrast, python is a  widespread language  in scientific community. My main goal was to automate immunofluorescence-inmunohistochemistry 
expression quantification in python. The program calculates three expression measurements: 
integrated intensity, area percent and mean gray value. 
To speed up, it uses parallel computation (300 images in ~2 minutes, using 4 cores). 
I have tested the program, analyzing my own images from calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1) inmunostaining (microglia marker) 
and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) inmunostaining (dopaminergic neuron marker). 

As soon as I publish the paper in a procedding or scientific journal I will upload the complete code. Before that, if you are interested in colaborate with me send me an email (marco.pena@unmsm.edu.pe).
