Scientists use to analyses microscopic images in ImageJ. Some of them use ImageJ macros to save time. 
There are few who program scripts in java to fully automate the process. In contrast, python is language 
widespread in scientific community. My main goal was to automate immunofluorescence-inmunohistochemistry 
expression quantification in python. The program calculates three expression measurements: 
integrated intensity, area percent and mean gray value. 
To speed up, it uses parallel computation (300 images in ~2 minutes, using 4 cores). 
I have tested the program, analyzing my own images from calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1) inmunostaining (microglia marker) 
and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) inmunostaining (dopaminergic neuron marker). 

As soon as I publish and paper in a procedding or in a scientific journal I will up load the complete code.
